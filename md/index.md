### Tracking Fake News

The Truth Value Project assigns a reputation to news articles depending on how closely they are associated with people spreading fake news on social media.
The algorithm starts by assigning high reputation to news from peer-reviewed scientific journals and some news agencies, and low reputation to articles from self-declared fake news sites.
The reputation then propagates to other articles according to who is spreading them. User votes (including your votes) also contribute to the reputation.

Low-reputation news articles should be met with skepticism, and we provide links that let you compare their content with other sources of news on the same topic.

We require people to login to search for arbitrary URLs to prevent abuse by automated bots. If you are interested in an API for our service, please contact info@truthvalue.org.
